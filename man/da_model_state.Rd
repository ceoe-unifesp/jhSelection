\description{
\code{da_model_state} collapses three independent sources of U.S. police-involved
fatalities—the FBI \emph{Supplementary Homicide Reports} (SHR), the
\emph{Fatal Encounters} (FE) project, and the \emph{Mapping Police Violence} (MPV)
database—into a common \emph{state × year × race × sex} taxonomy suitable for
regression and visualization.  Counts are harmonised with the Bureau of
Justice Statistics \emph{Law Enforcement Agency Identifiers Crosswalk} (LEAIC).
