\usage{
fit_model(
  da_model,
  offset_var = "fe",
  type = "fips",
  remove_unknown = TRUE,
  interaction = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{da_model}{A data frame containing the data to be used for modeling.
It should include columns for the counts of police-related deaths from different sources,
as well as demographic and geographic variables.}

\item{offset_var}{A string specifying the name of the variable to be used as an offset in the model.
Default is "fe" (Fatal Encounters counts).}

\item{type}{A string indicating the geographic level for fixed effects.
Options are "fips" for county-level fixed effects or "state" for state-level fixed effects.
Default is "fips".}

\item{remove_unknown}{A logical value indicating whether to remove records with "Unknown/Others"
Default is TRUE.}

\item{interaction}{A logical value indicating whether to include interaction terms
between sex and race. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A fitted model object from the \code{fixest} package.
}
\description{
This function fits a Poisson or Negative Binomial regression model to estimate
the relationship between police-related deaths recorded in different data sources,
adjusting for demographic factors such as sex, race, and geographic location.
